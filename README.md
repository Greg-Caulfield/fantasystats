# FantasyStats

Pulls week-by-week scoring data using the ESPN APIs to calculate the win/loss record of each player. 

Currently outputs a comma-separated string of the team ids, wins, losses, and points for. This gets copied manually into an google sheet to be shared.

### Future TODOs
Order the output of teams automatically based on wins then points for.  
Refactor to more than one big method.  
Move model objects into repositories.  
Expose endpoints to view stats on a per team basis. 

### Long Term Goals
Build corresponding frontend application using Vue.js.  
Host application on cloud provided servers.
